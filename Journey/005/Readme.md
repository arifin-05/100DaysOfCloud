## Cloud Research


### 1. IAM Roles for Service

So these IAM role will be just like a user, but they are intended to be used not by physical people.  The journey goes like this :


• Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf

• To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles

• Common roles:	

    • EC2 Instance Roles

    • Lambda Function Roles

    • Roles for CloudFormation

### 2. IAM Security Tools

but first let's talk about the kind of security tools. The journey goes like this :

• IAM Credentials Report (account-level).
 
    • a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials.


• IAM Access Advisor (user-level).
    
    • Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
  
    • You can use this information to revise your policies.
