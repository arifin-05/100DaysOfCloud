### Scalability & High Availability

- Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads by adapting.
- There are two kinds of scalability:
- Vertical Scalability
- Horizontal Scalability (= elasticity)
- Scalability is linked but different to High Availability

- Let’s deep dive into the distinction, using a call center as an example


### Vertical Scalability

- Vertical Scalability means increasing the size of the instance
- For example, your application runs on at2.micro
- Scaling that application vertically means running it on a t2.large
- Vertical scalability is very common for non distributed systems, such as a database.
- There’s usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale (hardware limit)


### Horizontal Scalability

- Horizontal Scalability means increasing the number of instances / systems for your application
- Horizontal scaling implies distributed systems.
- This is very common for web applications / modern applications
- It’s easy to horizontally scale thanks the cloud offerings such as Amazon EC2 


### High Availability

- High Availability usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling
- High availability means running your application / system in at least 2 Availability Zones
- The goal of high availability is to survive a data center loss (disaster)


### High Availability & Scalability For EC2

- Vertical Scaling: Increase instance size (= scale up / down)
  - From: t2.nano - 0.5G of RAM, 1 vCPU
  - To: u-12tb1.metal – 12.3 TB of RAM, 448 vCPUs
- Horizontal Scaling: Increase number of instances (= scale out / in)
  - Auto Scaling Group
  - Load Balancer
- High Availability: Run instances for the same application across multi AZ
  - Auto Scaling Group multi AZ
  - Load Balancer multi AZ


### Scalability vs Elasticity (vs Agility)

- Scalability: ability to accommodate a larger load by making the hardware stronger (scale up), or by adding nodes (scale out)
- Elasticity: once a system is scalable, elasticity means that there will be some “auto-scaling” so that the system can scale based on the load. This
is “cloud-friendly”: pay-per-use, match demand, optimize costs

- Agility: (not related to scalability - distractor) new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes.


### What is load balancing?

- Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 Instances) downstream.


### Why use a load balancer?

- Spread load across multiple downstream instances
- Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application
- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
- Do regular health checks to your instances
- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
- High availability across zones


### Why use an Elastic Load Balancer?

- An ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) is a managed load balancer
  - AWS guarantees that it will be working
  - AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
  - AWS provides only a few configuration knobs
- It costs less to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end (maintenance, integrations)
- 4 kinds of load balancers offered by AWS:
  - Application Load Balancer (HTTP / HTTPS only) – Layer 7
  - Network Load Balancer (ultra-high performance, allows for TCP) – Layer 4
  - Gateway Load Balancer – Layer 3
  - Classic Load Balancer (retired in 2023) – Layer 4 & 7


### Application Load Balancer

- HTTP / HTTPS / gRPC
- protocols (Layer 7)
- HTTP Routing features
- Static DNS (URL)


### Network Load Balancer

- TCP / UDP protocols (Layer 4)
- High Performance: millions of request per seconds
- Static IP through Elastic IP
