## Cloud Research


### #1. Amazon WorkSpaces


- Managed Desktop as a Service (DaaS) solution to easily provision Windows or Linux desktops
- Great to eliminate management of on-premise VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure)
- Fast and quickly scalable to thousands of users
- Secured data – integrates with KMS
- Pay-as-you-go service with monthly or hourly rates


### #2. Amazon AppStream 2.0 


- Desktop Application Streaming Service
- Deliver to any computer, without acquiring, provisioning infrastructure
- The application is delivered from within a web browser

    - The users connect to the VDI and open native or WAM applications
    - Workspaces are on-demand or always on

- AppStream 2.0
    - Stream a desktop application to web browsers (no need to connect to a VDI)
    - Works with any device (that has a web browser)
    - Allow to configure an instance type per application type (CPU, RAM, GPU)


### #4. Amazon Sumerian


- Create and run virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and 3D applications
- Can be used to quickly create 3D models with animations
- Ready-to-use templates and assets - no programming or 3D expertise required
- Accessible via a web-browser URLs or on popular hardware for AR/VR


### #5. AWS IoT Core


- IoT stands for “Internet of Things” – the network of internet-connected devices that are able to collect and transfer data
- AWS IoT Core allows you to easily connect IoT devices to the AWS Cloud
- Serverless, secure & scalable to billion of devices and trillions of messages
- Your applications can communicate with your devices even when they aren’t connected
- Integrates with a lot of AWS services (Lambda, S3, SageMaker, etc.)
- Build IoT applications that gather, process, analyze, and act on data
