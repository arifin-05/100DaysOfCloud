## Cloud Research


### #1. 


- A global application is an application deployed in multiple geographies
- On AWS: this could be Regions and / or Edge Locations
- Decreased Latency
    - Latency is the time it takes for a network packet to reach a server
    - It takes time for a packet from Asia to reach the US
    - Deploy your applications closer to your users to decrease latency, better experience
- Disaster Recovery (DR)
    - If an AWS region goes down (earthquake, storms, power shutdown, politics)…
    - You can fail-over to another region and have your application still working
    - A DR plan is important to increase the availability of your application
- Attack protection: distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack
