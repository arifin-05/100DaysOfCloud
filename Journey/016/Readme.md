### What’s an Auto Scaling Group?


- In real-life, the load on your websites and application can change
- In the cloud, you can create and get rid of servers very quickly
- The goal of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to:
  - Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load
  - Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load
  - Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of machines running
  - Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
  - Replace unhealthy instances
- Cost Savings: only run at an optimal capacity (principle of the cloud)


### Auto Scaling Groups – Scaling Strategies


- Manual Scaling: Update the size of an ASG manually

- Dynamic Scaling: Respond to changing demand
  - Simple / Step Scaling
   - When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%), then add 2 units
   - When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%), then remove 1
  - Target Tracking Scaling
   - Example: I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%
  - Scheduled Scaling
   - Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns
   - Example: increase the min. capacity to 10 at 5 pm on Fridays


## Auto Scaling Groups - Scaling Strategies


- Predictive Scaling
  - Uses Machine Learning to predict future traffic ahead of time
  - Automatically provisions the right number of EC2 instances in advance
   
- Useful when your load has predictable time - based patterns


### ELB & ASG – Summary 


- High Availability vs Scalability (vertical and horizontal) vs Elasticity vs Agility in the Cloud
- Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)
  - Distribute traffic across backend EC2 instances, can be Multi-AZ
  - Supports health checks
  - 3 types: Application LB (HTTP – L7), Network LB (TCP – L4), Classic LB (old)
- Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)
  - Implement Elasticity for your application, across multiple AZ
  - Scale EC2 instances based on the demand on your system, replace unhealthy
  - Integrated with the ELB
