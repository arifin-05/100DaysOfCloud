- SSH troubleshooting

## Cloud Research

- Which Lectures to watch
- Mac / Linux:
    - SSH on Mac/Linux lecture
- Windows:
    - Putty Lecture
    - If Windows 10: SSH on Windows 10 lecture
    - All: EC2 Instance Connect lecture


- Students have the most problems with SSH
- If things don’t work…
    1. Re-watch the lecture. You may have missed something
    2. Read the troubleshooting guide
    3. Try EC2 Instance Connect
- If one method works (SSH, Putty or EC2 Instance Connect) you’re good
- If no method works, that’s okay, the course won’t use SSH much
