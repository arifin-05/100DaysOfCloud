## Cloud Research


### What is Cloud Computing?

• Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources.

• Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing.

• You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need.

• You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly.

• Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services.

• Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.


### The Deployments Models of the Cloud

The Cloud Deployment Model is divided into 3 as below:

#### 1. Private Cloud:

• Cloud services used by one organization, not exposed to the public.

• Full control

• Security for sensitive applications

• Meet specific business needs

• shelf space

#### 2. Public Cloud:

• Cloud resources owned and operated by third party cloud service providers that are delivered over the Internet.

• Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

#### 3. Hybrid Cloud:

• Maintain multiple servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud

• Control over sensitive assets in your personal infrastructure

• The flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud

### The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

#### 1. On-demand self service:

• Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider

#### 2. Broad network access:

• Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms

#### 3. Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:

• Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy

• Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources

#### 4. Rapid elasticity and scalability:

• Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed

• Quickly and easily scale based on demand

#### 5. Measured service:

• Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used


### Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

#### 1. Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)

• Pay On-Demand: don't own hardware

• Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)

#### 2. Benefit from massive economies of scale

• Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale

#### 3. Stop guessing capacity

• Scale based on actual measured usage

#### 4. Increase speed and agility

#### 5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers

#### 6. Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure


### Problems solved by the Cloud

• Flexibility: change resource types when needed

• Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use

• Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes

• Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed

• High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers

• Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications


### Types of Cloud Computing

#### 1. Infrastructure as a Service (laaS)

• Provide building blocks for cloud IT

• Provides networking, computers, data storage space

• Highest level of flexibility

• Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT

#### 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)

• Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure 

• Focus on the deployment and management of your applications

#### 3.Software as a Service (SaaS)

• Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider

## Next Steps

• AWS Global Infrastructure
